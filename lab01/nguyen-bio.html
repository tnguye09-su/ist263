    <body>
        My name is Thanhngan Nguyen. I am an Information Management & Technology major with an interest in data analytics. Within this major I have been able to work with my peers to create and deliver presentations regarding technology and the future of tech, which helps me to increase my skills in communication and collaboration, skills which are important for any career. Outside of school, I enjoy watching movies and shows, one of my favorite movies being "Ponyo" by Studio Ghibli. Aside from watching movies/shows, I enjoy spending time with my family and friends.
